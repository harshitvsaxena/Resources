## package.json in NodeJS

The best way to manage locally installed npm packages is to create a package.json file.

To create a package.json file:

Open a terminal and `cd` to the place where you want to install the node modules. Now, use the following command:

```sh
$ npm init
```

This will initate a command line questionnaire that will conclude with the creation of a package.json in the directory you initiated the command. You can hit enter without entering anything to all the questions asked. It will still create a package.json file.

To add an entry to your package.json's dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install [package name without square brackets] --save
```
